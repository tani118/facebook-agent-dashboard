# Profile Picture Fixes Summary

I've fixed several issues with profile pictures not displaying correctly in the conversations panel and chat interface:

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Backend Profile Picture Fetching**
- Updated `FacebookMessageFetcher.fetchUserProfile()` to request additional profile picture fields: `profile_pic,picture.type(large)`
- Updated conversation fetching to include participant profile pictures: `participants{id,name,profile_pic,picture}`
- Updated message fetching to include sender profile pictures: `from{id,name,profile_pic,picture}`

### 2. **Conversation Sync Improvements**
- Enhanced `FacebookConversationService.syncConversations()` to properly fetch and store customer profile pictures
- Added fallback logic to check both `profile_pic` and `picture.data.url` fields
- Ensured existing conversations get updated with profile pictures if missing

### 3. **Frontend Profile Picture Handling**
- Added error handling (`onError`) to all profile picture `<img>` tags to fallback to default user image
- Updated profile picture resolution logic to check multiple sources:
  - `customerProfilePic` field
  - `message.from.picture.data.url`
  - `message.from.profile_pic`
  - Default user image fallback

### 4. **Conversation List UI Improvements**
- Added profile pictures to both `ConversationList` and `UnifiedConversationList` components
- Adjusted layout spacing to accommodate profile pictures (reduced width percentages, updated padding)
- Added profile pictures for both conversation items and comment threads

### 5. **Real-time Updates (WebSocket)**
- Updated webhook message handling to include profile pictures in socket payloads
- Enhanced Dashboard socket handlers to preserve profile picture data during conversation updates
- Updated ChatInterface socket handling to include profile pictures for new messages

### 6. **Comment Interface**
- Added better profile picture handling for Facebook post comments
- Included error handling and multiple fallback sources for comment author pictures

## Files Modified:

### Backend:
- `api/fetch-messages.js` - Enhanced profile picture fetching
- `services/FacebookConversationService.js` - Improved profile picture sync
- `routes/webhook.js` - Added profile pics to socket messages

### Frontend:
- `components/ChatInterface.jsx` - Error handling and better profile pic resolution
- `components/UnifiedConversationList.jsx` - Added profile pics to conversation list
- `components/ConversationList.jsx` - Added profile pics to conversation list  
- `components/Dashboard.jsx` - Preserve profile pics during socket updates

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Test New Conversations:**
   - Send a new message from Facebook Messenger
   - Check if the profile picture appears in the conversation list
   - Verify the profile picture shows in the chat interface

2. **Test Existing Conversations:**
   - Open existing conversations
   - Verify profile pictures are displayed correctly
   - Check that fallback to default user image works for missing pictures

3. **Test Real-time Updates:**
   - Have someone send you a message while the dashboard is open
   - Verify the profile picture appears immediately in real-time
   - Check that the conversation list shows the correct profile picture

4. **Test Error Handling:**
   - Check conversations with users who may have restricted profile pictures
   - Verify default user image is shown when profile pics fail to load

## Debug Script:
I've created `backend/debug-profile-pics.js` to help test profile picture fetching. Update the tokens and IDs in the script and run:
```bash
cd backend
node debug-profile-pics.js
```

## What to Check:

1. **Conversation Sidebar:** Should now show profile pictures next to each conversation
2. **Chat Messages:** Profile pictures should appear next to each message with proper fallbacks
3. **Customer Info Panel:** Should display profile pictures correctly
4. **Real-time Updates:** New messages should include profile pictures immediately
5. **Comments:** Facebook post comments should show commenter profile pictures

The profile picture system now has multiple fallback layers and better error handling, so even if Facebook's profile picture URLs are restricted or unavailable, the default user image will be shown instead of broken images.
